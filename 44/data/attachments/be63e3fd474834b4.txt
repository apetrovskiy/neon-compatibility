Error: There was a timeout while attempting to connect to the network at https://proxy.devnet.neonlabs.org/solana.
       Check to see that your provider is valid.
       If you have a slow internet connection, try configuring a longer timeout in your Truffle config. Use the networks[networkName].networkCheckTimeout property to do this.
